# Powerline-Multiplayer

# Description:
Powerline Multiplayer is a multiplayer puzzle coop game created inside the Unity game engine. Photon networking framework was used for the multiplayer segment of the game.

Levels are procedurally generated based on several customizable parameters where the A* algorithm assures that there is always at least one solution to the puzzle.

The game is now used as a part of a lecture about Online virtual environments at the FER university in Zagreb.

# How to use:
After starting the build (.exe file) control the camera with the mouse movement and zoom in/out with the scroll wheel.

Right-click locks the camera in position, left click rotates the wire blocks.

The goal of the game is to connect the wires from the generator to the distributor that powers the systems around you.
